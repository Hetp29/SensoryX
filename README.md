# SensoryX - AI That Experiences Your Symptoms

## 🧠 What is SensoryX?

SensoryX is the first AI that "feels" your symptoms and matches you with others who experienced the exact same sensations. Describe your symptoms naturally, and SensoryX finds your "symptom twin" - someone who had identical feelings and shows you what happened to them.

## 🎯 Problem We Solve

- 70% of rare diseases take 5+ years to diagnose
- People desperately search forums asking "does anyone else feel this?"
- Current symptom checkers only match generic symptoms, not specific sensations
- Patients can't describe symptoms in medical terms

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Describe naturally**: "Sharp pain behind my left eye when I swallow"
2. **AI vectorizes**: Converts your description into a mathematical "pain signature"
3. **Finds matches**: Searches millions of symptoms for identical sensations
4. **Shows outcomes**: Reveals what conditions your symptom twins had and what helped

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Three.js (3D visualization), Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **AI/ML**: GPT-4, Gemini API, Vector embeddings
- **Database**: Pinecone (vector search), Snowflake (symptom warehouse)
- **APIs**: Knot (financial correlation), ElevenLabs (voice), Dedalus (analysis)
- **Deployment**: DigitalOcean
